In
contrast to proliferating titles touting strategies for helping yours become a
missional church, Roxburgh offers a helpful critique and hopeful practices for
ministry in the Western church's changing context. Calling on his own experiences as a pastor,
and more recently as a church consultant, Roxburgh depicts a widespread sense
of disorientation besetting church leaders in our time. 

A map serves as his key metaphor throughout
for the way one makes sense of how the world works (xi). The primary map that has interpreted the world
and guided ministry for centuries came from modernity, and with its division of
subjective self and objective world, it is no longer tenable---new maps must be
made. He attributes the failure of
modernity's map to the effects of eight currents of change: globalization,
pluralism, rapid technological change, postmodernism, staggering global need,
loss of confidence in primary structures, the democratization of knowledge and
the return to Romanticism. In this
transformed world, strategic planning is impotent to form missional community
(79). Even the sociological and
historical work of missional authors such as Alan Hirsch are judged to be blatant
efforts to exercise the kind of control and management no longer possible
(109). 

While Roxburgh spends the greater part of his book
developing his portrait of a world in flux and the plight of ministry in this
context, his most promising contributions are found in the final chapters where
he outlines an alternative approach to cultivating missional community.

In **step one**, the leader begins to assess how
the environment has changed in the local context. This investigation should privilege people's
stories over demographic data.

Roxburgh
calls **step two** "redeveloping a core identity," by which he means cultivating
environments in which people can begin to believe they are God's people and
thus have the capacity to hear God in the biblical narratives, and in their own
lives (140). Here, eliciting people's
stories creates both a space of trust and a corporate sense that these stories may
be crucial in discerning God's future locally. 

**Step three** calls for the
creation of a parallel culture through experiments in Christian practices. Roxburgh urges that this be done in small
ways, not church-wide campaigns. This
could take shape as a group that meets to discuss their experience with the
daily offices of prayer, a monthly practice of hosting a stranger for dinner,
intentional friendships with the poor, and serious learning engagement with the
Biblical story.

**The fourth and final
step** is forming partnerships with the surrounding neighborhoods and
communities. The initiative for these
partnerships should arise from the ordinary people of God, for it is among
them, Roxburgh believes, that that Spirit of God dwells (170). Thus, it is they who must ultimately be the
missional map-makers. 

Roxburgh offers a compelling vision for missional
leadership that imagines the pastor primarily as a cultivator of communal
discernment rather than visionary. As a detective of divinity, the pastor calls
forth the missional vocation from the people of God rather than vision-casting for
a missional church.

While Roxburgh's
style is repetitive, his approach to the church's evangelistic calling is
refreshingly humble, contextual, communal and connected to the practices from
which zeal for witness inevitably arise.

_Missional Map-Making _offers an
accessible, hopeful, and practical contribution, especially to students and
pastors grappling with the changing contours of Western society and their
implications for ministry.
