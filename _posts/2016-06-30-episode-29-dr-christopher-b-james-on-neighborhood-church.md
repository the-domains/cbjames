  Dr. Christopher B. James joins me to talk about his research on church
  planting in Seattle, including the unique dynamics of the so-called " None
  Zone," the four expressions of church that his extensive research identified
  (Great Commission Team, Household of the Spirit, New Community, and
  Neighborhood Incarnation), and the gifts and liabilities of neighborhood
  expressions of the church.
