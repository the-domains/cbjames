Across the nation, pastors and church planters are encountering the reality that the church is in the midst of a season of dramatic cultural and religious shifts.

**Program Highlights**

\* _Community_: Cohorts form significant friendships and a network of fellow practioners from across the country.

\* _Year Round Interaction_: This program combines three annual one-week residencies, with fall and spring online interaction. Participants have access to the faculty members throughout the year as both instructors and mentors.

\* _Theological Depth_: The program guides participants in careful study and biblical reflection on the nature and practical significance of missional ecclesiology.

\* _Spiritual Renewal_: In addition to being academically rigorous, this journey is a profoundly spiritual one involving shared practices of prayer, immersion in Scripture, and discovering God in everyday life.

\* _Practically-oriented_: Participants work closely with their congregation, ministry, and local community throughout, culminating in a doctoral project that serves to equip the people of God for faithful ministry in your local context.

\* _Faithful Guides_: Unlike many D.min programs composed of various seminars and instructors, our cohort faculty---who are themselves scholar-practioners committed to following Jesus in their own ministry contexts---will see you through the program from start to finish.
