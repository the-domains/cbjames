Across the nation, pastors and church planters are encountering the reality that the church is in the midst of a season of dramatic cultural and religious shifts. These shifts have profound implications for ministry and mission. Led by Dr. Christopher James and Dr. Alan Roxburgh, this Doctor of Ministry Cohort at the University of Dubuque Theological Seminary will go on a journey of discerning the unique character of our emerging context, learn what kind of faithful leadership it requires and develop the critical spiritual and missional practices that equip us to join God's mission in the midst of our communities and neighborhoods.

**Dr. Christopher B. James** | Assistant Professor of Evangelism and Missional Christianity at the University of Dubuque Theological Seminary, Author of the forthcoming book with Oxford University Press, _New Churches in the None Zone_, based on his research among church plants in Seattle, WA | [www.chrisbjames.com][0] | [@chrisbjames][1]

**Program Highlights**

\* _Community_: Cohorts form significant friendships and a network of fellow practioners from across the country.

\* _Year Round Interaction_: This program combines three annual one-week residencies, with fall and spring online interaction. Participants have access to the faculty members throughout the year as both instructors and mentors.

\* _Theological Depth_: The program guides participants in careful study and biblical reflection on the nature and practical significance of missional ecclesiology.

\* _Spiritual Renewal_: In addition to being academically rigorous, this journey is a profoundly spiritual one involving shared practices of prayer, immersion in Scripture, and discovering God in everyday life.

\* _Practically-oriented_: Participants work closely with their congregation, ministry, and local community throughout, culminating in a doctoral project that serves to equip the people of God for faithful ministry in your local context.

\* _Faithful Guides_: Unlike many D.min programs composed of various seminars and instructors, our cohort faculty---who are themselves scholar-practioners committed to following Jesus in their own ministry contexts---will see you through the program from start to finish.
