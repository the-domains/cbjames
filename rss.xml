            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is Missional Good for Us?</h1><p>I've been a Christian as long as I can remember, but one of the important moments in my faith life was when I was in ninth grade... I had always been a good kid, but that year it came to my attention that being a Christian wasn't like being white or Korean, it wasn't something that you were just born with, but something more like being a soccer player-something that you actually do.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/225126e807f170ed9d4c52174da615ff71d4c693.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jesus Dust: How to Live in the Kingdom of God</h1><p>The Kingdom (or Reign) of God is the realm in which God's will is actualized. Thus heaven is a part of the Kingdom of God, angels are citizens in the Kingdom, animal life and all creation (generally speaking) are within the Kingdom of God.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/624c6fac53547a6e68a32dd0d1f9bf855048a36d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Newbigin's Gospel in a Pluralist Society: Summary]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Newbigin's Gospel in a Pluralist Society: Summary</h1><p>A while back I was invited to speak to a group called Theology on Tap about "The Gospel in a Post-Christian World.  The topic, it seemed to me, begged two questions.  The first is “What is the gospel?” and the second is “Where are we? What is this post-Christian world in which we live?”  Of course, putting those two questions next to each other raises a third:  Does when and where you are affect what the gospel is?  Does context matter for an understanding of the gospel?  Is the gospel different now than it used to be?  If so, how?  Or is the gospel something fixed, maybe a permanent set of doctrinal propositions or a universal set of ethical norms?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/070f388ce917b24823d4f55a4e5618e111f3a634.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ecclesial Pioneers in the Pacific Northwest</h1><p>The Pacific Northwest is one of the most fertile seedbeds for religious innovation and creativity in North America. To be sure, the separation of church and state has historically made North America as a whole an exceptionally open religious environment. That said, the Pacific Northwest (PNW) seems to exceed all other regions in its receptivity to religious experimentation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/91702014ba6674887e8db0ed35b41fd37dc31e0b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
