            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is Missional Good for Us?</h1><p>I've been a Christian as long as I can remember, but one of the important moments in my faith life was when I was in ninth grade... I had always been a good kid, but that year it came to my attention that being a Christian wasn't like being white or Korean, it wasn't something that you were just born with, but something more like being a soccer player-something that you actually do.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/225126e807f170ed9d4c52174da615ff71d4c693.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Thus heaven is a part of the Kingdom of God, angels are citizens in the Kingdom, animal life and all creation (generally speaking) are within the Kingdom of God.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/624c6fac53547a6e68a32dd0d1f9bf855048a36d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Newbigin's Gospel in a Pluralist Society]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Newbigin's Gospel in a Pluralist Society</h1><p>A while back I was invited to speak to a group called Theology on Tap about "The Gospel in a Post-Christian World.  The topic, it seemed to me, begged two questions.  The first is “What is the gospel?” and the second is “Where are we? What is this post-Christian world in which we live?”  Of course, putting those two questions next to each other raises a third:  Does when and where you are affect what the gospel is?  Does context matter for an understanding of the gospel?  Is the gospel different now than it used to be?  If so, how?  Or is the gospel something fixed, maybe a permanent set of doctrinal propositions or a universal set of ethical norms?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/070f388ce917b24823d4f55a4e5618e111f3a634.jpg"></article>]]></description>
